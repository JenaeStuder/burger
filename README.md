## Burger is a full stack application using Express, MYSQL with a homemade ORM, and Handlebars and CSS for styling.

## It takes the seed files and posts them to the screen allowing the users to click on them to devour, which appends them to the "Tab" portion of the screen. They are able to create their own burgers which are then appended to the bottom of the "Classics" section and then if they choose to devour it, it is appended to the "Tab" portion like the original seeds.
